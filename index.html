        <p><strong>To My Favorite Human (Yes, You're Stuck With Me hehehe)</strong></p>

        <p>If someone had told me that one day I’d be making an entire website just to tell one girl how much she
          means to me… I would’ve said, “Me? Really?”... and laugh it out.</p>

        <p>And yet here I am. Coding feelings. Debugging emotions. Hosting my heart on the internet because
          saying “I love you” normally is not enough.</p>

        <p>Out of billions of people in this world, somehow my life chose you. And honestly? Best algorithm ever
          written.</p>

        <p>You are my calm in chaos. My “ninie nomnommm??” reminder. My 2am (Indian time hehe) comfort voice. My FUTURE
          WIFE.</p>

        <p>I love the way you pretend you're not
          soft but then melt when I just say "My Love".</p>

        <p>I love our random arguments about how you're always right. (You always are). I even love the pauses when you
          say,
          “I’m fine.” (You’re not fine. But I love you anyway.)</p>

        <p>Even when you're feeling stuck in routine, tired, distant, or overwhelmed — you are never ordinary to me. You
          could sit in silence and I’d still choose that silence with you over noise with anyone else.</p>

        <p>Distance is annoying. It’s frustrating. It makes us stare at flight prices like a man and woman possessed.
          But it’s
          temporary.</p>

        <p>One day, instead of “goodnight” on a screen, it’ll be me pulling you closer. One day we won’t count time
          zones — we’ll argue about who stole the bunkieee... then later just cuddle up under one bunkieee</p>

        <p>You are my person. My safe place. My favorite notification. My forever teammate.</p>

        <p>I choose you when we’re laughing. I choose you when we’re stressed. I choose you when you’re overthinking. I
          choose you in every version of you.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be you. And I’ll handle the rest.</p>

        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.</p>

        <p>Scroll down and look at all the memories we’ve already built.</p>

        <p>And imagine how many more we’re about to create.</p>



        <p><strong>Forever yours. Always. ❤️</strong></p>

        <p>
          You are the most special person in my life. Every moment with you is a treasure.
          I just wanted to make this to show you just how much you mean to me. I love you so much my baby heart. And i
          will always love you no matter what.
          Please don't ever leave me okay? I can't live without you. I just want to be with you forever and always. I
          hope you love this, and this isn't the end. There's so much more.
          I'm really sorry that sometimes I'm not the best boyfriend, but i promise i'll try my best to be the best for
          you. I love you so much.
          <br><br>
          Love always,<br>
          Your ninie bunch ❤️
